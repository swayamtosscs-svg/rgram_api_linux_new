# Live Streaming API with Viewer Tracking

## Key Features Added
- âœ… **Active Viewer Tracking**: Track who is currently watching the stream
- âœ… **Viewer History**: Record when viewers join/leave and watch duration
- âœ… **Real-time Viewer Count**: Accurate count of current viewers
- âœ… **Viewer Details**: Get detailed information about active viewers

      "isPrivate": false
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Leave Stream
```http
POST /api/live/leave
```
**UPDATED**: Now properly removes from active viewers and updates viewer history.

## Testing in Postman

### Step 1: Start a Stream
1. Use the "Start Live Stream" endpoint
2. Save the returned `streamId`

### Step 2: Go Live
1. Use the "Go Live" endpoint with your `streamId`
2. **NEW**: You'll now see viewer information in the response!

### Step 3: Join as Viewer
1. Use the "Join Stream" endpoint
2. Use a different `viewerId` than the streamer
3. **NEW**: You'll see the viewer added to `activeViewers`

### Step 4: Check Viewers
1. Use the "Get Stream Viewers" endpoint
2. **NEW**: Get detailed information about all current viewers!

### Step 5: Leave Stream
1. Use the "Leave Stream" endpoint
2. **NEW**: Viewer will be removed from active viewers

## Database Schema Updates

The `LiveStream` model now includes:

```typescript
interface ILiveStream {
  // ... existing fields ...
  activeViewers?: string[]; // Currently watching viewers
  viewerHistory?: Array<{
    viewerId: string;
    joinedAt: Date;
    leftAt?: Date;
    watchDuration?: number; // in seconds
  }>;
}
```

## Viewer Tracking Flow

1. **Stream Starts**: `activeViewers` is empty, `viewerCount` is 0
2. **Viewer Joins**: Added to `activeViewers`, `viewerCount` increases, entry added to `viewerHistory`
3. **Viewer Leaves**: Removed from `activeViewers`, `viewerCount` decreases, `viewerHistory` updated with leave time and duration
4. **Real-time Stats**: Always get accurate current viewer count and list

## Benefits

- ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate Viewer Count**: No more duplicate counting
- ðŸ‘¥ **Real-time Viewer List**: Know exactly who is watching
- ðŸ“Š **Viewer Analytics**: Track join/leave patterns and watch duration
- ðŸ”’ **Private Stream Support**: Control who can view private streams
- ðŸ“± **Mobile App Ready**: Perfect for real-time viewer updates

## Example Postman Test Flow

```bash
# 1. Start stream
POST /api/live/start
# Save streamId from response

# 2. Go live
PUT /api/live/go-live
# Now returns viewer info!

# 3. Join as viewer 1
POST /api/live/join
# Viewer added to activeViewers

# 4. Join as viewer 2
POST /api/live/join
# Both viewers now in activeViewers

# 5. Check current viewers
GET /api/live/viewers?streamId=your_stream_id
# Get detailed viewer information!

# 6. Leave as viewer 1
POST /api/live/leave
# Viewer removed from activeViewers

# 7. Check viewers again
GET /api/live/viewers?streamId=your_stream_id
# See updated viewer list
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Viewer ID not showing in response
**Solution**: Make sure you're calling the "Get Stream Viewers" endpoint after viewers have joined the stream.

### Issue: Viewer count not updating
**Solution**: Ensure you're calling the join/leave endpoints properly. Check that `viewerId` is valid.

### Issue: Active viewers array is empty
**Solution**: Viewers need to join the stream first using the "Join Stream" endpoint.

## Next Steps

- Implement real-time WebSocket updates for live viewer count
- Add viewer engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares)
- Create viewer analytics dashboard
- Add viewer notifications when stream goes live

**Note**: This API now provides complete viewer tracking capabilities. When testing in Postman, you'll see viewer IDs and detailed viewer information in the responses!
