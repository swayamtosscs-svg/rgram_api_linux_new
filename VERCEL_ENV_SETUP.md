### 3. Redeploy Your Project
After adding all environment variables:
1. Go to **Deployments**
2. Click **Redeploy** on your latest deployment
3. Or trigger a new deployment by pushing to GitHub

## üîç How to Check Current Environment Variables

You can check what environment variables are currently set by adding this to any API route temporarily:

```typescript
// Add this to any API route to debug
console.log('Environment Variables:');
console.log('NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL:', process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL);
console.log('VERCEL_URL:', process.env.VERCEL_URL);
console.log('NODE_ENV:', process.env.NODE_ENV);
```

## üß™ Test the Fix

After setting up the environment variables and redeploying:

1. **Test the forgot password API**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST "https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/api/auth/forgot-password" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"email": "swayam121july@gmail.com"}'
   ```

2. **Check the email** - the reset link should now point to:
   ```
   https://api-rgram1.vercel.app/reset-password?token=...
   ```

3. **Click the link** - it should work correctly

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If the link still shows localhost:
1. Make sure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set to `https://api-rgram1.vercel.app`
2. Redeploy your project after adding the environment variable
3. Check that the environment variable is applied to Production environment

### If you get "This site can't be reached":
1. Make sure the reset password page exists at `/reset-password`
2. Check that all API routes are working
3. Verify the token is valid and not expired

### If emails are not sending:
1. Check that all email environment variables are set
2. Verify your Gmail app password is correct
3. Ensure 2FA is enabled on your Gmail account
